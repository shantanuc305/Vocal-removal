# Vocal-removal
# Overview
This project focuses on source separation for music, specifically vocal removal from audio tracks. It uses Demucs (Deep Extractor for Music Sources), a state-of-the-art deep learning model for music source separation, fine-tuned to achieve improved accuracy in isolating vocals and instrumentals.

The implementation is done in Python, leveraging open-source machine learning libraries for model training, inference, and evaluation.

Remove vocals from songs to obtain instrumental tracks.

Extract isolated vocals for remixing, karaoke, or analysis.

Fine-tuned Demucs model for enhanced separation quality.

Python-based implementation with simple CLI interface.

Support for multiple input formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC).
